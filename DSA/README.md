# Unique Integer Processor

## Overview
The Unique Integer Processor is a Python program that reads integers from an input text file, filters out duplicates, and ensures that only valid 32-bit signed integers are stored. The unique integers are then written to an output text file in sorted order.

## Features
- Reads integers from a specified input file.
- Validates each integer to ensure it is a 32-bit signed integer.
- Stores unique integers while maintaining sorted order.
- Outputs the unique integers to a specified output file.
